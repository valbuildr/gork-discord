# gork-discord

a _very_ simple discord bot written in discord.py that simply replies to '@gork is this real'

there is a very small chance (1 in 100) that the bot will reply with 'probably', all other itmes it'll just say 'idk you figure it out'

very much inspired by [espeon/gork](https://github.com/espeon/gork), which does a simillar thing on [bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/gork.bluesky.bot).
